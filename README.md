## Instructions

### To reuse the code from this project

Ensure you installed everything from the Prerequisites section and additinally install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Open your unix terminal (or at least git bash on Windows) and execute the following commands(just copy&paste everything into the terminal and press Enter):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yashaka/selenidejs-demo.git selenidejs-demo \
&& cd $_ \
&& npm install \
&& code .
```

Open the project in the PyCharm. Check the code in google-finds-selenide.js and run it by either pressing context click on the file and selecting «Run» or by selecting «Terminal» item in menu «View>Tool Windows» and running:

```bash
python google_finds_selene.py
```

Enjoy the result!

P.S.
You may find that your google search results are different from the ones in the video. This is because Google is constantly changing its search algorithm. So, if you see different results or different amount of results, and your test fails, it's not the problem. Let it be your task to adjust the code to make it work again;)
